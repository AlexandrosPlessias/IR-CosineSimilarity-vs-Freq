# IR-TF-IDF
Information Retrieval, implementaion of TF-IDF, cosine similarity and other tasks.
I create a vector Information Retrieval Model to the research interests of the Faculty members of the Department (a.k.a. DEP or professors) and based on this to suggest possible collaborations between them.

* Question 1 . Finding important terms for each faculty member. In this question you are asked to characterize with a set of terms the research interests of each faculty member. Use the Vector Model and the tf-idf load to represent each faculty member as a weight vector of the terms contained in the titles of his research articles and conferences / journals that have been published. Your implementation should, after doing the above, create the profile "prof-description.txt" that will have 26 lines (as many faculty members) and each line will contain the last name of the faculty member followed by the N most important terms together with their weights in the form (term, weight), which were found in the titles of the articles and the respective journals / conferences. N will be a parameter of your program.

* Question 2 . Find a faculty member based on a question. In this question you are asked to sort the faculty members based on their relevance to a question posed by the user. To do this you will characterize with a set of terms the research interests of each faculty member as you did in Question 1 using the Vector Model and tf-idf load. This way, the user will ask you a question in one or more terms (eg, truth model driven system with enable the nearest database.) And you will calculate the similarity of each member of the faculty with the question and you will rank them based on the similarity you calculated. Note that whatever you pre-processed in your data, you should do the same in the user's questions! Your implementation should, after doing the above, create the results- "question-words" .txt file (eg, results-truth-model-driven-system-with-enable-the-nearest-database. .txt for our example), which will have 26 lines (as well as faculty members) and each line will contain the surname of the faculty member followed by the similarity with the question in the form (surname, similarity). The file should be sorted in descending order of resemblance to the question.
